# Introduction
A simple terminal Tetris game, with a look inspired by bastet.

It can also serve as a reference on how to interact with the terminal without **ncurses**. It contains code examples on how to overwrite the screen without flicker, receive input, interpret arrow keys, and handle resizing. Note that it is overwriting the screen and not clearing, to clear a character instead of ovewriting it needs to be overwritten with a space.

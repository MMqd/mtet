# Introduction
A simple terminal Tetris game, with a look inspired by bastet.

This was my first terminal program on linux, and I found many basic tasks difficult. Over time I researched ways to preform these basic tasks, and I hope this game/aggregate of mini-tutorials will come in handy. It can also serve as a reference on how to interact with the terminal without **ncurses**.

It contains code examples on how to:
* overwrite the screen without flicker
* receive input
* interpret arrow keys
* handle resizing
* get the user's path
* pass flags to the program

Note that it is overwriting the screen and not clearing, to clear a character instead of ovewriting it needs to be overwritten with a space.
